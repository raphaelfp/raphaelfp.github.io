# Welcome to my GitHub Pages

I built this website to show the apps I created or I'm working on.

This personal website was built in React with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool by Facebook.

## Who am I?

My name is Raphael, I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais and I'm a Software Developer Intern at DTI Technologies at the moment. I'm also a member of the Developer Circles in my city and in the last 6 months I started my journey to dive deep in the Javascript world.

## My Tech Stack

* Javascript/ES6/ES7
* NodeJS/Express
* React/Redux
* MongoDB
* Angular 2+
* HTML/CSS/SASS
* C/C++
* C#/.NET
* Python, Lua, LaTex, and some academic related technologies.


## Why Javascript?

Because Javascript is AWESOME!!!!!!!!

About a month ago, I started to dive into the Javascript world. In the past, I've written some Javascript code for the company I work for, but when I started taking some React and NodeJS classes, I discovered that I didn't know anything about the Javascript world. Almost all my colleagues think Javascript is not really a programming language, or that is for lazy people, is not safe, full of bugs... And I have discovered that this is not true and I fell in love with Javascript.

I've done some courses at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com):
* [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux) - [My certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-WQ9OZN2Z)
* [Advanced React and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial) - [My certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-NILQN28W)
* [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development) - [My certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-16NOQE3N)

And I'm also learning GraphQL, React Native, D3.js, and other Javascript Framework/Libraries.
